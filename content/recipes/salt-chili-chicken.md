## Ingredients

- 800g skinless chicken breast fillets
- 2 large eggs
- 1 cup of almond flour
- 1/2 cup whey protein isolate
- 3 tsp garlic powder
- 3 tsp Chinese five spice
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional)
- 1 large onion
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 medium size carrot

## Method

1. Whisk eggs in a bowl
2. Dice up the chicken fillets to desired chunk size
3. Dip the chicken into the egg mix and ensure its evenly soaking for 30 minutes
4. Put the almond powder, whey protein, five spice, salt, pepper and garlic onto a large plate and mix well
5. Carefully dredge the chicken through the flour mixture piece by piece and make sure each piece is well coated
6. Once all chicken is done, leave for about 30 minutes
7. Start heating up your oil in a deep pan or deep fryer
8. Deep fry the chicken pieces in about 3 batches or depending on the size of your cooking container. In my case, it was
   a medium sized saucepan so space was an issue
