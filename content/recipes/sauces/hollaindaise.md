Pairs exceptionally well with steak and is one of the primary components in eggs
benedict.

A little patience is required for a traditionally made Hollaindaise due to the
emulsification process. Too hot, the eggs will scramble but also requires a
liberal amount of whisking.

## Equipments

- Water bath (bowl over but not touching a saucepan of simmering water)
- Whisk

## Ingredients

- 2 egg yolks
- 100g butter (ideally clarified but can be done on the fly by letting dairy
  solids sit)
- 1 tbsp white wine vinegar OR lemon juice

## Method

1. Bring water in saucepan to a light simmer (must not be boiling as eggs will
   scramble)
2. Melt butter in a pan and remove from heat or alternatively in bursts in the
   microwave (to avoid exploding butter)
3. Add egg yolks to bowl, start whisking, when lukewarm add vinegar/lemon
4. Incorporate the butter in several stages, slowly but whisking vigorously
5. Once the mixture has thickened and all butter is incorporated, remove bowl
6. Lightly season with salt and pepper or optionally paprika
