## Notes

Most cocktail jiggers are 1 & 1/2 oz measures.

Where 1.5 oz roughly = 45ml

and 1 oz (small side - pony shot) roughly = 30ml

## Ingredients

- 1 & 1/2 oz rum. (1 and a half typical cocktail jigger's larger side)
- 1 oz lime juice.
- 1 tsp sugar or half jigger of simple syrup.
- 3-4 mint leaves.
- Soda water
- Ice (best with crushed slushy ice)

## Method

Pour rum, lime juice, ice and sugar into a shaker and give it a good shaking.
The sugar should be dissolved. If you're using simply syrup, the syrup should be
well incorporated and not stuck to the base of the shaker.

Smack your mint leaves to release the aromas and rub them around the inner lip
of the glass.

Put the leaves into a glass with the rum mixture and muddle them. You can put
the leaves into the shaker afterwards if you want but it isn't necessary.

Pour into a glass and give it a quick stir.

Pour over some soda water to taste.

Enjoy!
