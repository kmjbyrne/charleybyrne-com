## Method

1. Add a small drop of olive oil at a time so you don’t split the yolks
2. Speed up the drip rate as you go, paying attention to any separation
3. When it starts to thicken, add a drop of lemon juice to loosen the mixture
4. Continue adding the oil and lemon in balance
5. Mince the garlic with the salt then stir through the emulsified mixture
6. Enjoy!
