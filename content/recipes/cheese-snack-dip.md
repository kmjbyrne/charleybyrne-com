## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 cup of milk
- 1 1/2 cup (60g) cheddar cheese
- 1/4 tsp salt
- (Optional) 1/4 tsp chili powder for an extra kick

## Method

1. Add the butter and flour to a saucepan
2. Heat and whisk together until they get bubbly, continue for a minute
3. Whisk into the milk and wait until it comes to a simmer
4. The ideal state here is the mixture sticking to your cooking utensil without
   immediately slipping off
5. Mix in the cheddar cheese, bit by by
6. Lower the heat, melt all together but don't overcook the cheese
7. Once the cheese is melted down, mix the remaining ingredients
