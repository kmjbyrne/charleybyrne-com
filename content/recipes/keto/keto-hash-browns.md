I buy cauliflower riced purely out of convenience but the bags typically come in
two packs of 160g each.

Cauliflower rice is better strained through a cheesecloth to remove as much
moisture. Food will effectively be poached if there is too much water during
cooking. Hash browns are better when a nice crust can form.

## Ingredients

- 4 cups (8x 160g packs) riced cauliflower
- 1/2 cup (42g) grated parmesan
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt or to taste
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Method

- 200C for about 45 minutes
