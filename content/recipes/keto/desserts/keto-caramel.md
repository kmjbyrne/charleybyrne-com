NOTE: to use pure stevia, you will need to factor in the sweetness to volume
ratio. Using stevia you should use far less, usually no more than a single
teaspoon per 1 cup of blended sweetener or sugar.

## Ingredients

- 8 tbsp (115g) of butter
- 1 cup (270g) sweetener (not pure stevia)
- 1 cup (240ml) double cream
- Pinch of salt (add more for salted caramel)
