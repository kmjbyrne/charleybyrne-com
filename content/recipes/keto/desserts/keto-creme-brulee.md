Crème brûlée is a French cuisine dessert consisting of a rich custard base
topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar. The custard base is
traditionally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other
flavorings. Sometimes, the dessert garnished with fruit.

Makes ~4 servings.

## Equipment

- 4 ramekins
- Large pan or casserole dish

## Ingredients

- 6 large egg yolks
- ~500ml (2 cups) double cream (generally two cartons in this part of the world)
- 1/4 cup (50g) sweetener (have tried with erythritol)
- 4 tsp sweetener (for topping)
- 1/2 tsp vanilla essence / extract

## Method

- Preheat oven to 170°C
- Heat some water in a kettle just short of boiling, pour into baking pan or
  dish to about one half the height of a ramekin
- In a bowl, mix egg yolks and 2 tbsp of sweetener, beat well
- In a small pan, pour double cream, remaining sweetener and vanilla. Leave on
  heat until cream begins to bubble slightly
- Once bubbling, remove pan from heat
- Slowly drip in the egg yolk, bit by bit, whisking as you go (must continue
  whisking)
- Divide the combined mixture into 4 individual ramekins
- Place the ramekins into the pan with water
- Cook for about 25-30 minutes or until the consistency is just a bit jiggly but
  mostly set
- Remove from oven and let cool for about 1 hour
- Cover with clingfilm and refrigerate overnight
- (Optional) when ready to serve, sprinkle 1tsp of sweetener on each serving,
  use a culinary torch to caramelize the sweetener
- Serve with whipped cream, raspberries or whatever
- Enjoy
