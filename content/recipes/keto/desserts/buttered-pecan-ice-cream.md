Currently experimenting with using 1 tbsp collagen protein OR 2 tbsp vodka OR
some xantham gum as a stabilizer to mitigate the risk of the mass becoming rock
solid and inedible without a pick axe. The other approach to handle this is
simply waiting longer for thaw (but that's boring).

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup (28g) crushed pecans
- 2 tbsp ground hazelnuts (optional)
- 4 tbsp butter
- 3 tbsp sweetener (I use erythritol + stevia blend)
- 8oz (240ml) double cream
- 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
- 3 tbsp powdered sweetener
