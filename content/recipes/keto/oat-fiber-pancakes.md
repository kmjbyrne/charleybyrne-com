## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup oat fiber
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp coconut oil (melted)
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 3 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp vanilla essence
- (Optional) 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder

### Variant

- Add 1/3 cup coconut flour
- Add 2 large eggs
- Add 1/2 cup buttermilk

For toppings, use butter, berries or whatever you want.

> For another variant that packs a little extra protein, substitute 1/4 cup
> almond flour with 1/4 cup whey protein isolate.

## Method

1. Mix dry ingredients together in a bowl
2. Mix in oil, buttermilk and eggs until well combined. Add additional egg or
   water if batter is too thick
3. Scoop batter onto heated pan using a ladle to size you prefer, then flatten
   each into a circle. It's best to use about 4 tbsp (or 1/4 cup) of batter for
   each pancake
4. Cook until sides are golden brown
