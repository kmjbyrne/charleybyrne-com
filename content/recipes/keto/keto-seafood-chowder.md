This creamy seafood chowder recipe foregos milk and instead takes advantage of double cream's lower 
carbohydrate count. Milk local to this country at least, contains approximately 4.7g per 100ml which 
would amount to + 13gs of sugars (from lactose). Double cream on the other hand has 2.6g per 100ml 
of product. Onions and carrots have their own share of carbohydrates (natural sugars) so cream allows
for these aromatics to remain, giving a hearthy flavour boost and additional goodness.

Ratio approximations for carbohydrates, fats and proteins is 1:6:3.

Glucomannan is used a thickener to preference. I like a thick creamy consistency, if you prefer less
viscous chowder, reduce the glucomannan amount to 1/5 tsp and increase 1/4 tsp at a time to preference.
