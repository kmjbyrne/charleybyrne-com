This base acts a simple base (it's not a strong flavour) that other dishes can
overlay.

Most restaurants will use a cup or more of oil when preparing bases. Although
this will enhance flavour, it can be made a little less calorie dense by just
using a little less oil.

## Ingredients

Makes 4 bases which can be easily sub divided into another 4 dishes.

- 4 tbsp (60ml) neutral oil
- 4 large onions, chopped
- 1 bulb garlic cloves (5 single clove)
- 2 tbsp minced ginger
- 2 large carrots, chopped
- 1 green pepper
- 1 red pepper
- 1 yellow (since most packs include the yellow one, might as well use it!)
- 500g passata (1 pack) or 1 can of chopped tomatoes
- 2 cups (500ml) water
- 1 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tbsp cumin
- 1 tbsp coriander
- 1 tbsp turmeric
- 1 tbsp fenugreek
