recipe.

## Ingredients

Serves 4 or more

I include 1kg of chicken typically (4-6 large breasts). Which means I can divide
the dish into 4 or 5 servings. Note that 250g chicken as sold is usually between
70-80g of protein per serving. This is about 60g if serving 5. This is a
subjective preference as I get the majority of my protein from dinner.

- 30ml (1 tbsp) ghee
- 30ml (1 tbsp) sunflower oil
- 800g to 1kg chicken - cubed
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 500ml curry base sauce
- 3 garlic cloves, minced or paste
- knob of ginger, minced or paste
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 green cardamom pods, crushed
- 3 tbsp sugar / sweetener / 2 tbsp stevia for keto
