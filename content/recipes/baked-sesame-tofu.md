## Ingredients

### Baked Tofu

- 500g block of firm tofu. I used Tahoe Super
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 0.5 tsp MSG (optional)
- Salt to taste but use less if using MSG

### Sesame Soy Sauce

- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp honey or sugar-free sweetened isomalto-oligosaccharides if low carb
- 1 tsp minced garlic (add another 1 tsp if you like extra garlic flavour)
- 1 tsp minced ginger
- 1/2 tsp dried red chili flakes (add 1 tsp added kick)
- 100ml water
- 1/4 tsp xanthan gum
  - If the sauce is very thin, add another 1/8 tsp xanthan gum at a time, stir
    and cook for a minute
  - You can indeed use cornstarch or arrowroot according to direction if not low
    carb.
- Handful chopped spring onions

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C
2. Chop the tofu block into cubes and mix with the sesame oil, soy sauce, salt
   and optional MSG to a bowl
3. Space out the tofu on baking paper and bake for about 35 minutes. Add 7-10
   minutes if you like crispier tofu
4. Meanwhile, add the second soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic,
   ginger, honey to a pan and cook on medium for 1 or 2 minutes
5. Add the dried chili flakes
6. Add the water and thickening agent (xantham or preferred alternative) and
   stir
7. When the sauce thickens, remove from heat
8. When the tofu is finished, add it to the sauce and mix together on low heat
   for 1 or 2 minutes
9. Garnish with spring onions

Enjoy!
