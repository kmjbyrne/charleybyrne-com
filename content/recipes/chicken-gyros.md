NOTE: this recipe calls for thighs, the skin on thighs add more flavour due to
their fat content. Breasts can be a little drier however so caveat emptor when
opting for different cuts.

- 1 tsp coriander
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1kg chicken thigh (skin on for extra flavour, skinless for healthier variant)
