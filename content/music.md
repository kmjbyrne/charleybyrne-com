I began learning audio engineering as a supporting skill set some years back to
allow my ideas to better come to life without unjustifiable costs for
production. Avid [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) user and supporter. Purchased
a license after 682 days of use ðŸ™‚ IYKYK. I write, record, produce, mix and
master (poorly) my own tracks. SoundCloud <https://soundcloud.com/charleybyrne>.
Currently working on a cosmos themed instrumental album that is pending some TLC
and commitment.
