A head melting game I discovered a few years ago.

Shared by a solid dude I worked with at the time. Plenty of people joke about the despair of using JavaScript. Erling
Ellingsen decided that it would be fun to gamify it. Because you didn't have enough suffering, right? ðŸ˜‹

## Return True

Welcome to the weird, the bizarre, the frustrating, the strange, the JavaScript: <https://alf.nu/ReturnTrue>.

Today, things have matured to some degree and we should be grateful for that. Evolution of all things can be at times,
strange.

I mean who doesn't love Flash or SilverLight.
