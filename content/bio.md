## Work

A little about me perhaps?

Irish man. Software engineer by day. Been in the game for a few years now. It
has been a decent journey. Blessed to have worked with some great people so far.
Life's best asset!

Currently navigating the second largest river in the world.

## Play

Double as a fully unpaid part-time musician by night.

I share on this website various facets of I. You can check out some of my tech
ramblings, how tos, hard learned gotchas, etc by visiting my [wiki](/wiki). I
cover a range of topics which is likely to grow over time.

Years ago, I used to play music more actively and in live settings with any
opportunity that presented itself. These days, I have ventured into more
technical stuff. I write, record and engineer a host of different stuff. I am
currently working on an spacey-post-blues-rock instrumental project that
initially started in 2015-2016 (thereabouts).

YouTube has been a great way to capture this chronology. I share some content
when I can: <https://www.youtube.com/user/MundusMedia/videos>

## Eat

I have an ardent love of making stuff in general, that extends particularly to
cooking. I keep a repository of recipes I have found useful and tweaked. Check
them out by visiting the [recipes section](/recipes). No life stories, that's a
perpetual promise.
